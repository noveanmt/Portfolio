            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a third-year student at the University of Cincinnati, studying Cybersecurity and Information Technology.
                With a 4.0 GPA and a spot on the Dean's List every semester, I am committed to both academic excellence and continuous learning. <br /><br />

                I recenlty joined 84.51° on the Infrastructure and Cloud Technology team as a Service Desk CO-OP, where I provide front-line IT support and help identify
                and resolve technical issues across enterprise systems. I also deploy and configure PCs and Macs, and I am working to automate redundant and time-intensive tasks to help make our team more efficient.
                This role allows me to further strengthen my problem-solving skills, collaborate with engineering teams, and contribute to user-focused, cloud-based solutions in a fast-paced environment. <br /><br />

                Beyond the classroom, I assist the IT Learning Center in streamlining their processes and overall efficiency by implementing technological solutions.
                Over the summer I was also the Area Supervisor of Training and Auditing at Kings Island, where my team and I oversee training,
                auditing, and the development of 400 seasonal lifeguards. These experiences have shaped my ability to manage teams, uphold high standards,
                and create engaging training programs. <br /><br />

                I am passionate about theme parks and the themed entertainment industry, and I serve as the President of the Themed Entertainment
                Association (TEA) at UC. Our mission is to connect students with the themed entertainment industry by fostering creativity, professional
                development, and collaboration. Through networking events, industry panels, and hands-on projects, we help students explore careers all
                around the theme entertainment industry. Leading this club has allowed me to bridge my love for technology, training, and storytelling, helping
                others discover and grow their passion for the industry. <br /><br />

                Outside of my academic and professional work, I am dedicated to giving back to the community through volunteering. I work with Saturday Hoops,
                a program that mentors underprivileged kids through sports, art, and life skills, helping to build confidence, connection, and personal growth.
                Similarly, I volunteer with Pause, where I support families of children with developmental disabilities, mental health challenges, and chronic
                conditions by creating a fun and safe space for their kids while parents take time to recharge. These families face immense challenges every day,
                and by providing them with a moment of respite, we allow them to return to their responsibilities feeling refreshed and supported. Beyond just providing
                care, Pause is about creating connections letting these families know they are not alone. <br /><br />

                I thrive on creativity and innovation, whether it's developing new training strategies, integrating technology into operations, or finding unique
                solutions to challenges. My passion lies in making processes not just functional, but engaging and effective-blending structure with adaptability
                to bring out the best in both people and systems. Whether it's through training, themed entertainment, or mentorship, I am driven to create experiences
                that are both meaningful and memorable. <br /><br />
