            <h2>TA Managment System (TAMS)</h2>
            <p>
                I developed and continue to enhance the TA Management Software (TAMS) to modernize and streamline the IT Learning Center’s time tracking and administrative
                processes. Before TAMS, TAs signed in and out using paper logs, creating an administrative nightmare when verifying attendance for office hours.
                The process took an average of 5 hours a week between three people to maintain, leaving them only able to discover attendance issues after the fact rather than addressing them proactavely. <br /><br />

                Seeing this gap in efficiency, I took the initiative to design and build a scalable solution from the ground up. Recognizing the problem, I didn’t just find a workaround, I
                created a lasting solution. Through iterative prototyping and continuous refinement based on user feedback, I developed TAMS to consolidate and automate key processes,
                significantly improving efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility. Now, student coordinators can proactively address attendance issues with a single click, transforming a
                tedious 5 hour task shared by three people into a streamlined process that takes less than 10 seconds to verify and take action. This represents a 99.9% reduction in time spent, allowing coordinators to focus on supporting the TA's and students.

                <br /><br />
                But TAMS has since grown far beyond attendance tracking, TA scheduels, class assignments, and TA Notes . It now serves as a comprehensive session note system, replacing the previous
                Microsoft Forms process with a more efficient and human centered design. Previously, TAs were required to manually enter up to 17 separate fields per session. They would ask students
                a series of repetitive questions that often led to incorrect or incomplete data due to fatigue or time pressure especially when they had back-to-back or virtiual sessions. After listening
                to feedback from our TAs, I worked closely with the team to rethink the entire session note experience.

            <p>
                The process now begins with a student-driven check-in form that automatically pre-populates key session information. This allows TAs to focus their attention on
                supporting the student rather than collecting redundant data. TAs only need to complete three meaningful fields as the student has unknowingly provided the rest of the requires information dramatically
                reducing cognitive load and improving the accuracy and consistency of the data. This redesign not only simplifies the workflow for TAs, but also enables the IT Learning Center to measure the
                efficiency and completeness of session documentation by tracking the time from when a session note is opened to when it is closed.
                <br /><br />

                The new process has also implemented a robust review and flagging system, giving student coordinators the ability to proactively monitor session quality. 
                Student feedback is now directly tied to session notes, providing a more transparent and actionable view of how well we’re supporting academic success. Session notes can be reopened or
                flagged for a follow-up which enhances both oversight and support for students and TAs.

                This evolution reflects one of my core beliefs that well designed systems bring out the best in both people and processes; empowering users while driving meaningful impact.

            <h2> MTN Training Solutions: 360 Training</h2>
            <p>
                After four years as a lifeguard, I noticed a recurring issue in traditional lifeguard training:
                a strong emphasis on reacting to emergencies, with far less focus on proactively
                recognizing and preventing them. While emergency response is critical, the foundation of effective
                lifeguarding is prevention. Being able to identify a Guest in Distress (GID) before an incident occurs.

                When I became a Lifeguard Instructor in 2024, I knew our training methods needed a serious upgrade.
                PowerPoint presentations filled with static information were no longer engaging or effective for today's learners.
                They didn’t align with the real-world skills lifeguards would be using on stand especially
                scanning, pattern recognition, and decision-making under pressure because we were just talking about them.

                One of the biggest challenges was preparing new guards before their first day on stand with actuall guest in their zone of protection,
                especially since my facility operates seasonally. I saw this limitation not as a barrier but as an opportunity to innovate.
</p>
                <h3>The Solution: Immersive, Low-Stakes Practice Environments</h3>

                <p>
                    I launched the <strong><a href="https://noveanmt.github.io/360Training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MTN Training Solutions: 360 Lifeguard Training Program</a></strong>, a scalable and immersive training tool
                    designed to simulate real-world scanning environments. <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bring the behaviors we teach in the classroom to life through interactive practice</li>
                        <li>Create a low-stakes environment for trainees to receive feedback and develop instinctual recognition</li>
                        <li>Build neural networks around what GIDs look like and how different factors influence recognition</li>
                        <li>Help candidates develop confidence before they ever go on stand</li>
                    </ul>
                </p><p>

                The training uses 360-degree video and VR environments to show dynamic, waterpark scenes
                from the perspective of a lifeguard. Trainees are asked to scan for GIDs, identify patterns, and react
                all while receiving real-time coaching or after-action feedback. The prototype shown was accessible starting on a desktop , giving lifeguards a way to build scanning fluency
                even without physical access to the pool. Since then, I’ve continued refining the training, enhancing realism
                and implementing VR for even greater immersion. This program is now a core part of our pre-season training and serves as a vital bridge between the classroom knolage
                and in park performance. By giving trainees realistic, repeatable opportunities to practice scanning,
                we equip them to be not just reactive, but proactive lifesavers.
                <br/><br/>
                This initiative reflects my belief that training should evolve with the needs of its audience. It’s not just about checking off a certification. 
                For me it’s about creating a culture of vigilance, adaptability, and confidence. With the right tools and systems in place, we can help lifeguards 
                truly understand their role, and empowering them to act before a rescue is ever needed, and equiping them to be successful from day one.

            <h2> EyeSee - Security Camera Installation</h2>
            <p>
                To enhance security in off-campus housing, I designed and deployed a private surveillance network integrating IP cameras, AI-driven event analytics,
                and a locally hosted Blue Iris server. This system provided real-time monitoring, eliminated cloud storage reliance, and successfully deterred
                burglars in five incidents while maintaining 95% uptime. <br />

            <p>
                Training should be engaging, immersive, and impactful. To reinforce scanning techniques, I designed 'Lifeguard Spot It!' a custom game that transforms lifeguard
                skills into an interactive experience. Using discrete mathematics and Python, I was able to make a lifeguard themed Spot It! card deck, making training both educational and fun.
                By blending creativity with training, I strive to ensure lifeguards are confident, prepared, and ready to make a difference.
